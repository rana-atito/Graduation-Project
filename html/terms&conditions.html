                    of the Services are made available under various names. You also acknowledge that the Services may

                    1.2.1 Protected Services Some of our Services are protected by technical measures intended to
                    safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of sensitive information our Users store
                    and share using our Services. We call these “Protected Services.” One such safeguard is requiring
                    each User to be properly authenticated by means of authorization (“Credentials”), such as unique
                    identifiers, usernames, passwords, and the like. In order to obtain Credentials, you must provide
                    certain information about yourself. If you are registering for a Protected Service, or accessing or
                    using, or attempting to access or use, a Protected Service on behalf of, or for the benefit of,
                    someone other than yourself – such as any of your family members (each, a “Principal”) – you must
                    also identify and provide information about each Principal. Further terms and conditions related to
                    User Registration These Protected Services are all Services that build you a personal Medical Record
                    (“Medical History”), such as receiving your medical information and results from Providers like
                    laboratories, scan centers and physicians’ accounts. This data is completely private and secured and
                    we hereby guarantee so. You are the owner of the data and by clicking “I agree”, you give the
                    Providers the right to send you the information through your private account on the Site. In order
                    to help you build your own electronic Medical Record, you may agree to send a copy of this data to
                    the supplier doctor through our Services, which will be protected and kept private as well and
                    cannot be shared with third parties. The supplier doctor will keep it under your name on his account
                    for building your Medical Record at the clinic. In case you do not agree to keep a Medical Record of
                    your data, you can send Vezeeta your request expressing your desire not to share, and Vezeeta shall
                    comply with this request.

                    Our Services allow you to access reviews and other forums where various Users can share information,
                    opinions, ratings and other Content. We generally do not pre-screen or monitor submitted Content,
                    and such Content may simply represent a user's opinion. Our Services may also include survey
                    results, ratings or testimonials ("Evaluations") from users that may endorse, recommend, critique,
                    analyze, evaluate or otherwise describe the Providers and the nature or quality of the Services
                    received by such user. Such Evaluations are anecdotal first-hand accounts of individual Users, and
                    do not constitute neither a Provider's judgment nor the product of medical science. You should
                    understand that the Evaluations expressed therein are of those who provide the same, that it does
                    not reflect the opinions of Redak, and does not in any way constitute or imply our endorsement or
                    recommendation thereof. Thus, Redak shall not assume any liability for any of the posted
                    Evaluations. Further, you should bear in mind that Evaluations are subject to errors and biases that
                    are common in anecdotal first- hand accounts, and should not to be presumed to be reliable or
                    error-free. Any Content that you obtain or receive from Redak, its employees, contractors, partners,
                    sponsors, advertisers, licensors or otherwise through the Services, is for informational, scheduling
                    and payment purposes only. All information is for informational purposes only, and does not
                    constitute medical advice. The information offered on the Site is not a substitute for medical
                    advice from qualified healthcare professionals. If you rely on any Content, including reviews, you
                    do so solely at your own risk. We encourage you to independently confirm any Content relevant to you
                    with other sources, including the Healthcare Provider's office, medical associations relevant to the
                    applicable specialty, your state medical boards, and the appropriate licensing or certification
                    authorities to verify listed credentials and education.
